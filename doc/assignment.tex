\section{Questions} \label{questions}

As required, the following questions have been answered:

\subsection{Contribution}
The contribution toward the entire project was an even split. We both felt as though the work we had contributed was worth 50\% each.

\subsection{Reflection} \label{reflection}

% Which aspects of your overall program do you consider to be particularly well done?
Some of the smaller modules in our codebase have been implemented quite well. For example, the Timer and Bencode modules have a very focused purpose and were discrete enough to be able to be doctested.
We found that making use of recursion in the Bencode module reduced the complexity that would have otherwise occurred.
The Timer module has many features that we didn't end up using but could be useful in the future if we decided to continue developing this project.
We also had a clean user-interface that clearly displays the current routing table and some other information about the router.
Our protocol adds a CRC32 checksum to the data being sent, this is checked when the packet is received and dropped if it is incorrect. This protects our routers from receiving garbled packets.



% Which aspects of your overall program could be improved?
The overall system design could be improved.
We rewrote some modules several times in order to get it to feel as though it would be easy to work with.
We would also spend more time planning the project and understanding the exact steps required to implement the specification.
Our current solution only receives at most 4096 bytes of data when reading a packet, this means that we can only send a maximum of 81 full router table entries in a packet. This could become an issue if we had a router with more than 80 directly connected neighbors but could be overcome by sending another packet with the remaining entries.


\subsection{Event Processing} \label{event_processing}

% How have you ensured the atomicity of event processing?
Our entire program is based around a main loop that waits for incoming packets and if it doesn't receive any, it will do other things, such as updating the timers, updating the routing table, rendering the screen, etc. We use lists to ensure that our incoming packets are serviced in the order in which they arrive. When packets are processed, they may trigger updates to the routers neighbors. These updates are serviced after the periodic updates have finished being received. Once these updates have been sent to its neighbors, the router simply waits for more information to arrive.

In order to ensure the atomicity of events in our program we have made use of timer-driven functions and their timers in such a way that they do not  interrupt other events. Our entire program is single-threaded so we don't need to worry about interruptions from other parts of the program.


\subsection{Testing} \label{testing}

Many of the smaller functions in the project were discrete enough that we could use doctests on them.
We created many configuration files for testing our config module. Some configuration files were well-formed and some were not. This allowed us to make sure that our config module worked as expected.

Once we had most of the program working we had to create test configuration files for entire networks. We found this process to be very tedious and so, wrote a program to generate these files for us (see section \ref{generatenet}). Our testing became much easier after this as we didn't have to manually write these configuration files.
